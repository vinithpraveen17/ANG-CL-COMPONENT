<!-- this is the app.component.html file, which is the 'root' of the Angular project. -->
<h1>Welcome to Angular</h1>

<p>Angular is a powerful framework that allows the developer to modularize their websites by creating
'components' - these are custom combinations of html, css, typescript, and testing files that represent
a reusable portion of the site. You can think of a component as being similar to a Class in an OOP language -
in fact, Components in Angular are technically classes written in Typescript.</p>

<p>A Component in Angular looks a bit like a custom HTML tag. One such component has already been written
inside of this project, and we'll be adding it to the page now. If you're viewing this text from your browser, then
  navigate to the file src/app/app.component.html and add the component described in the comments.</p>

<!-- TODO: add the line below to the HTML code:
    <app-my-first-component></app-my-first-component>
    If you're still not convinced of the power of components, try adding it multiple times.-->
<div class="todo-container">
        
  <p>TODO: add the line below to the HTML code: {{template}}. If you're still not convinced of the power of components, try adding it multiple times.</p>

<p>tip: Angular features live-reloading, so when you modify and then save a file (ctrl+s if you don't have
  autosave on) the page will be reloaded in the browser. </p>

<p>The actual component code is located in
src/app/components/my-first-component, and new components could be created using the command
  "ng generate component (component-name)" in the terminal</p>
